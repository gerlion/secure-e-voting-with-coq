# Secure E-Voting with Coq
This repository contains the code associated with the CCS 2019 paper
"Verified verifiers for verifying elections" by Thomas Haines, Rajeev 
Gore and Mukesh Tiwari.

# Summary

This repo contains the first steps in ongoing work to have machine checked
code for the cryptographic primitives that are used in e-voting.  In addition,
the work extends to proving that using the primitives in a certain way suffices
for the integrity of the tallying process up to some specific limitations (which is commonly called universal 
verifiability).

This tool is useful for getting confidence in the validity of the verification
specification but is no substitute for extensive and open critique.  
Please read the corresponding paper for discussion of the limitations.

# Verified code for verifiable elections
Both the Coq and OCaml code come with makefiles 
# Dependencies 
The Coq Proof Assistant, version 8.8.2  
OCaml, version 4.03.0  
unix,zarith,batteries,yojson,atdgen,ppx_deriving
# Coq code
Running make helios.vo will prompt Coq to check the proofs  
Running make Extraction.vo will prompt Coq to extract the libaries
# OCaml Code
Running make compile will prompt OCaml to compile  
Running make run will will verify the election data for Helios IACR 2018  

## Note: 
This is not the development repo for the ongoing work.  Place contact 
Thomas Haines (thomas.haines@ntnu.no) with any questions or for
the latest version.
